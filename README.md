# Clatsop County Oregon building footprints

in ESRI shapefile format

This is where they came from:

I downloaded Oregon data from https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints, 
then using an ESRI model in Toolbox.tbx,

1. Converted to shapefile oregon_buildings.

2. Selected shapes in Clatsop County.

3. Exported to shapefile clatsop_buildings in web mercator projection.

There is also an MXD file here that I used to publish the footprints to ArcGIS.
